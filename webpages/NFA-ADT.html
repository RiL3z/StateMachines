    <h1>Nondeterministic Finite Automaton Abstract Data Type</h1>
    <p>The NFA (nondeterministic finite automaton) can be thought of as a simple machine that can determine if input strings belong to languages that it is describing. It exhibits parallelism in that the machine can take multiple branches in determining if an input string belongs to the language.</p>
    <h3>Formally speaking, an NFA consists of 5 major parts:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A finite set of states.</li>
      <li>A finite alphabet that the machine can read symbols from.</li>
      <li>A transition function that decides how the machine transitions from state to state.</li>
      <li>One starting state that the machine begins execution in.</li>
      <li>A set of final states. If the machine is in any one final state when all the input is read, the machine accepts the string as belonging to the language it describes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>From this description, an abstract data type can be imagined that supports the following methods:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>addState(label): Adds a state to the machine with the given label. Labels should be unique so one state is always distinguishable from another.</li>
      <li>addTransition(state, symbol, nextState): Adds a transition from one state to another.</li>
      <li>addFinalState(label): Adds a final state to the machine.</li>
      <li>NFA(startLabel): Creates an NFA object with the start state labeled with startLabel.</li>
      <li>test(expression): Runs the machine on the expression string in order to determine if it is acceptable or not.</li>
    </ul>
